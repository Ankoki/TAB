# About
TAB aims to be a superior all-in-one minecraft plugin for displaying information that outperforms all 
similar plugins in terms of features, performance, compatibility and support.  
More information can be found at [Why TAB?](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Why-TAB%3F) wiki page.

# Distribution
As of TAB 3.0.0, released with MC 1.18 (November 30th, 2021), there is no free / premium
version anymore. Only one version of the plugin exists now, which contains all implemented features
and is available to everyone for free. However, customer support is only provided to 
customers who have purchased the plugin (see [Customer support](#customer-support)).  

# Compiling
Compilation requires JDK 17 and up.  
To compile the plugin, run `./gradlew build` from the terminal.  
Once the plugin compiles, grab the jar from `/jar/build/libs/` folder.  
The universal jar contains all modules for all supported platforms.

# Customer support
Unlike with other projects where requirements and level of support provided are unclear,
we provide a clear answer to what kind of service you will or will not receive. Some projects don't
even clearly state if they are free or paid. While they are listed as paid on spigot, they have
a free download link in description, which can be confusing.  
Support is also quite often "we have a discord server, but don't ping devs for support", suggesting
there is no official support, just the community.

In TAB, everything is clearly defined. **Downloads are free, but services are paid.**  
The plugin is free to download for everyone. The only exception might be occasional update delays
for free users once a year.  
Customer support, however, is only provided to customers who have formally purchased a copy 
of the plugin on any of the websites the plugin is being sold on:  
* [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/14009/)
* [Polymart](https://polymart.org/resource/484)
  
After purchasing, you can request assistance via either private messages on the website where you
have purchased it, or using [TAB's Discord server](https://discord.gg/EaSvdk6) (which is highly 
preferred, since the communication will be much faster thanks to notifications and more).  
* We use a ticket system, which allows us to effectively track any amount of unresolved problems.
No more questions getting lost in the sea of messages from other people asking. Tickets are only closed
after user confirmed all of their questions were answered and then receive a transcript of the ticket
from the bot after ticket is closed into private messages (unless user is blocking them).
* We do not rely on the community helping, which often makes things even worse. We know people have
better things to do than helping random people with a random plugin, especially when most people only
have a very basic knowledge of the plugin, not being able to answer more complicated problems.
* We have notifications enabled and reply as soon as possible. We do not have the server muted unlike
most mods on most servers who only check it when they are really bored, give a wiki link and 
disappear again.
* As the developer, I do not rely on helpers providing support instead of me. They are handy as
I am obviously not available 24/7, but I do not intentionally leave anything to them. I reply
whenever I am available without any intentional delays.

# Issues
The [Issues](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/issues) section is **only** available for cases included in templates.
In other words, they **are not available for**:  
* **Support** - support is provided on discord for buyers, where roles are given to verified users
allowing us to know who bought it and who didn't. It also serves as a much faster way of communication.
* **Feature requests** - closed indefinitely.
  
**If you're a customer, please use discord for reporting bugs, especially if you aren't good at making bug reports. 
You will be provided with a much faster and higher quality service.**
