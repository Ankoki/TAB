# About
TAB aims to be a superior all-in-one minecraft plugin for displaying information that outperforms all 
similar plugins in terms of features, performance, compatibility and support.  
More information can be found at [Why TAB?](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Why-TAB%3F) wiki page.

# Distribution
As of TAB 3.0.0, released with MC 1.18 (November 30th, 2021), there is no free / premium
version anymore. Only one version of the plugin exists now, which contains all implemented features
and is available to everyone for free. However, customer support is only provided to 
customers who have purchased the plugin.  

# Compiling
Compilation requires JDK 8 and up.  
To compile the plugin, run `./gradlew build` from the terminal.  
Once the plugin compiles, grab the jar from `/jar/build/libs/` folder.  
The universal jar contains all modules for all supported platforms.

# Issues
The [Issues](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/issues) section is **only** available for cases included in templates.
In other words, they **are not available for**:  
* **Support** - support is provided on discord for buyers, where roles are given to verified users
allowing us to know who bought it and who didn't. It also serves as a much faster way of communication.
* **Feature requests** - closed indefinitely.
  
**If you're a customer, please use discord for reporting bugs, especially if you aren't good at making bug reports. 
You will be provided with a much faster and higher quality service.**
